Southern Adventist University is a quaint little university nestled in the hills just east of *Chattanooga*, TN.  By small, I refer to the total number of students being about **4000**. 

I have been hired to start a Physical Therapy Assistant Program. The university has decided to move forward with an Allied Health Department expansion and Physical Therapy Assistant programming is to be the start of the movement. The university is primarily a Nursing and Religion focused institution. However, this is the sign of a great shift moving into the future. 

My first week has been very unusual. First, my immediate boss and his boss is off for the week. This meant that no one was here to provide direction as to my duties. Therefore, I just took the assignment and began researching out the requirements.
